AWARE Analytics - Hidden Alpha Discovery

Finds undervalued traders that the public leaderboard misses.
The "Moneyball" of prediction markets.

Discovery Methods:
1. Anomaly Detection - Exceptional performance that doesn't fit normal patterns
2. Rising Stars - New traders with exceptional early performance
3. Niche Specialists - High edge in specific market categories
4. Anti-Correlated - Traders who profit when consensus fails
5. Strategy Outliers - Unique trading patterns via clustering
