"""
AWARE Analytics - Insider Detection System

Detects potential insider trading activity on Polymarket.

Unlike traditional markets, prediction markets have NO insider trading laws.
This creates an opportunity: detect "someone knows something" signals
BEFORE news breaks, and trade alongside them.

Detection Signals:
1. NEW_ACCOUNT_WHALE: New account + big bet + rare market
2. VOLUME_SPIKE: Unusual volume increase before news
3. SMART_MONEY_DIVERGENCE: Top traders betting against consensus
4. WHALE_ANOMALY: Known whale changes typical behavior

Example (real case):
    "New account created, bets $50k on Maduro capture.
     No public news. 24 hours later: Maduro captured."

Usage:
    detector = InsiderDetector(ch_client)
    alerts = detector.scan_for_insider_activity()
    for alert in alerts:
        print(f"ALERT: {alert.signal_type} - {alert.description}")
