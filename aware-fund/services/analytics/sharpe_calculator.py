AWARE Analytics - Sharpe Ratio Calculator

Calculates annualized Sharpe ratio from daily P&L data.

Formula:
    daily_returns = P&L grouped by resolved_at date
    sharpe = (mean(daily_returns) / std(daily_returns)) * sqrt(365)

Note: We use 365 days (prediction markets trade daily) not 252 (stock trading days).

A Sharpe is only as good as the sample behind it. Annualising by sqrt(365)
multiplies whatever noise is in the daily figures by 19, so a short history
does not produce an approximate Sharpe -- it produces a meaningless one.

# This was 3 -- the docstring above claimed 7 -- and three daily observations
# annualised by sqrt(365) is noise, not a ratio. It showed: the median stored
# Sharpe was -4.45, one trader in six sat pinned at the +10 cap, and 92 were
# below -100 (the worst, -1.8 billion, from a near-zero standard deviation).
# The leaderboard duly showed 10.00 for every visible trader.
#
# Nothing is lost by waiting. Every trader currently has between 3 and 9 days
# of resolved P&L, so this yields no rows until the history is there, and an
# empty Sharpe column is the honest answer to "how consistent is this trader"
